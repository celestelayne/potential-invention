### Course Description

This course is about **thinking and designing with code**. Code is not just a technical skill but a medium of thought, speculation, and design. Each week you will learn the mechanics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while building **digital gardens**: living, evolving web spaces that resist the homogeneity of platforms and reflect individual voice, curiosity, and care.

We will explore the digital garden as both design practice and cultural critique: What does it mean to publish a site that is never finished? How can architectural thinking shape pathways, nodes, and rooms of knowledge online? How might AI tools scaffold experimentation without erasing individuality?

Through lectures, readings, and hands-on coding exercises, students will create experimental web projects (“gardens”) that balance technical fluency with critical design inquiry. The goal is to reclaim the web as a medium of cultivation, not consumption—crafting websites that grow, link, and evolve like living knowledge spaces.

No prior coding experience is required—only curiosity, a willingness to experiment, and a desire to rethink what the web can be.

### Course Theme

*Personal Webcraft: Digital Gardens and the Future of Individuality*

This semester, we explore digital gardens as a contemporary model for personalized web practices — spaces that are always evolving, interconnected, and expressive of individual voice. but to cultivate living systems of knowledge and design inquiry. We will ask:

* What does it mean to design a digital garden — a site that grows, links, and transforms over time — rather than a static portfolio?
* How do personal, evolving sites offer an alternative to platform-driven feeds and homogenized templates?
* How can AI-enabled design tools (e.g., Figma’s generative features, automation platforms) act as collaborators in experimentation without erasing individuality?
* How might architectural thinking shape digital “gardens,” “studios,” or “rooms” online, where pathways, nodes, and spaces embody ideas as much as buildings do in the physical world?
